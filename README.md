# Emojify

As an exercise of NLP course, the project uses word vector representations to build an Emojifier.

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:
"Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Let's get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Dataset - Emojiset

# Models
- A baseline model (Emojifier-V1) using word embeddings.
- A more sophisticated model (Emojifier-V2) that further incorporates an LSTM.
